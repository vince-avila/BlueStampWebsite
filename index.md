# Infinity Mirror Clock
Throughout my three weeks at BlueStamp, I have been working on building an LED Infinity Mirror Clock. Circuits and coding with the Arduino Uno became the biggest parts of the project, but the hands on work with these circuits and putting everything together was the most fun.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.
