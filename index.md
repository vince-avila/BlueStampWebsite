# Infinity Mirror Clock
Throughout my three weeks at BlueStamp, I have been working on building an LED Infinity Mirror Clock. Circuits and coding with the Arduino Uno became the biggest parts of the project, but the hands on work with these circuits and putting everything together was the most fun.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone for my project was getting familiar with the RTC module and how it works. I was able to find a tutorial on YouTube for using the RTC module with an Arduino. I used the schematic given in the video to build my circuit, connecting pin to pin with dupont wires. I connected the ground and power pins of the arduino and the module together, and I connected the SCL and SDA pins on the arduino to the same pins on the module. Using the code below I was able to input the time and date of the day I modified it to start the clock. In order for the code to read the input, obtain the information from the module, and display it, I had to first input the time and date, upload the code, then comment out those three lines and upload it again. With the clock portion of my project up and running, I was ready to move on to the bigger circuit for milestone two.
