# Infinity Mirror Clock
Throughout my three weeks at BlueStamp, I have been working on building an LED Infinity Mirror Clock. Circuits and coding with the Arduino Uno became the biggest parts of the project, but the hands on work with these circuits and putting everything together was the most fun.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
This is my first milestone for my project, the LED Infinity Mirror Clock. The clock uses an RTC module, which stands for Real Time Clock, to keep track of time, and an Arduino to take in the code I use to make different color patterns, timestamps, etc. Other pieces like the LED strip, mirrors, and border are all for making the clock portion way nicer than a little module. So for my first milestone I set up the RTC module. As you can see I connected it to the breadboard which is connected to the Arduino that is connected to my computer via my cable. So here is the code that makes the RTC module work. These three lines here are all to set the time for the RTC Module to keep repeating, but as you can see they are all commented. This is so the information from the RTC module can be printed in the serial monitor, which is where we will be monitoring the recording of the time. These three lines down here are responsible for printing the information in the serial monitor. And then down here is just how long the program will wait to display another time, which is 1000 milliseconds, or one second. A challenge I faced was getting the right library for my code. I needed the right library because inside it holds all of the resources I need for my code to work. The problem was rooted all the way back to how I transferred my files to the Arduino folder on my computer.
